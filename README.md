# Weather App Demo
A demo for a desktop weather app with basic city search functionality utilizing weather data from the free [Current Weather plan](https://openweathermap.org/current) from [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/). All weather data are based on estimates for the 12:00:00 timestamp. Features experimental dynamic light/dark themes based on system preferences.
